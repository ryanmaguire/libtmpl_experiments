 *      If a knot or link L has been completely smoothed by some resolution   *
 *      of the crossings, the result is a collection of cycles. The           *
 *      contribution of this resolution is (-q)^{w(k)} (q + q^{-1})^{c(k)}    *
 *      where w(k) is the Hamming weight of the resolution k, the number of   *
 *      1's in the binary expansion of k, and c(k) is the number of cycles.   *
 *      The total formula for the Kauffman bracket is:                        *
 *                                                                            *

 *      where [L] denotes the Kauffman bracket of L. Given the weight, number *
 *      of cycles, a possible "degree-shift", and an array of coefficients    *
 *      corresponding to [L] (being computed in-progress), add the Laurent    *
 *      polynomial (-q)^{w(k)} (q + q^{-1})^{c(k)} to the array.              *
 *  Arguments:                                                                *
 *      cycles (unsigned int):                                                *
 *          The number of cycles corresponding to a complete smoothing.       *
 *      weight (unsigned int):                                                *
 *          The Hamming weight of the integer representing the smoothing.     *
 *      degree_shift (unsigned int):                                          *
 *          A shift factor for the degree. The zeroth element of the input    *
 *          array should correspond to the coefficient of the lowest degree   *
 *          term in the polynomial. Since this is a Laurent polynomial this   *
 *          term can be negative, positive, or zero. The degree_shift term is *
 *          used by the caller to ensure the entries of the expression        *
 *          (-q)^{w(k)} (q + q^{-1})^{c(k)} are added to the correct elements *
 *          of the input array.                                               *
 *      coeffs_array (signed int *):                                          *
 *          An array of coefficients for the Laurent polynomial of [L]. It is *
 *          assumed that this has been allocated sufficient memory and that   *
 *          at the start of the computation (i.e., before the first calling   *
 *          of this function), that the coefficients have been initialized to *
 *          zero. Bounds on the size of the Kauffman bracket mean that no     *
 *          more with 3*WIDTH + 2 elements are needed for the array, where    *
 *          WIDTH is the width of unsigned int (usually 32-bits).             *
 *  Output:                                                                   *
 *      None (void).                                                          *
 *  Method:                                                                   *
 *      The number of terms in (q + q^{-1})^n is 2n + 1. Every other term is  *
 *      zero, so we can perform the sum in increments of two. If the weight   *
 *      is odd we need to subtract (q + q^{-1})^n instead of add. We loop     *
 *      through all of the coefficients and perform the arithmetic.           *
